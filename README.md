Here are my tuned configuration files for my Red Alert 2 & Yuri's Revenge F[AI]r Mod Project. ARES and Phobos script integration for realism has been implemented at minimal levels. In this document, I will list all the changes I made on original files, from the general contents to the detailed attributes. Feel free to use them for your modding project. 

P.S.: Do not forget to buy a coffee for me if u appreciate my work :)
